-How these files can be read:

1. **First Line**: This line contains three integers separated by spaces:
   - The first integer represents the number of nodes \( m \) in the network.
   - The second integer represents the number of edges \( n_{\text{edges}} \) in the network.
   - The third integer represents the number of commodities \( nC \).

2. **Edge Lines**: The next \( n_{\text{edges}} \) lines describe the edges in the network. Each line contains seven integers:
   - The first two integers represent the nodes that the edge connects.
   - The third integer, \( d_{ij} \), represents the distance or some other metric between the connected nodes.
   - The fourth integer, \( u_{ij} \), represents the capacity of the edge.
   - The fifth integer, \( c_{ij} \), represents the cost associated with using the edge.       

3. **Commodity Lines**: After the edge lines, there are \( nC \) lines that describe the commodities. Each line contains three integers:
   - The first two integers represent the origin and destination nodes for the commodity.       
   - The third integer, \( b_{ij} \), represents the demand for that commodity between the origin and destination.
